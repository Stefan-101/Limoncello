# Limoncello

Limoncello is a task management and collaboration tool, inspired by Trello, built with the power of **ASP.NET** on the backend and **Bootstrap** for a responsive, sleek frontend. This application allows teams and individuals to organize projects, tasks, and workflows visually using boards, lists, and cardsâ€”making it easy to track progress and collaborate efficiently.

## Features

- **Boards & Lists**: Create boards to represent projects and lists to categorize tasks within each board.
- **Task Cards**: Add, edit, and move task cards between lists to reflect the progress of your work.
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for task management.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using Bootstrap to ensure a seamless experience across all device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and modern UI for easy navigation and task tracking.
- **Real-time Updates**: Tasks and boards update instantly, ensuring that all users stay on the same page.
- **Task Assignments**: Assign tasks to different team members and monitor progress.
- **Due Dates and Labels**: Add deadlines and labels to categorize tasks and set priorities.

## Technology Stack
